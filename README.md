# 📚 QuizApp

Welcome to **QuizApp**! 🎉

A question-and-answer app built with **React Native** to showcase my development skills. The backend is powered by **Django** and runs in the cloud. The app offers two game modes:

- **Database Mode:** Questions are fetched from a **NoSQL** database hosted on **Azure**.
- **AI Mode:** Questions are dynamically generated using a **Large Language Model (LLM) via OpenAI**, making the experience unique every time.
